about:
  jobtitle: Systems developer
  me: |
   Well designed systems have the power to take away the mundane and repetitive parts of our lives, whether they drive industrial robots in a widget factory, accounting calculations on a spreadsheet or stock level reporting for an onine superstore. I like to build well designed systems, and am capable of delivering them whether working individually or with a small team of like minded people. I have a broad range of skills and knowledge, but more importantly, pick up new skills and concepts very quickly. And although I always strive for elegance in design and implemention, I recognize when it is pragmatism, rather than perfection, that is called for.

    I designed this CV as a programming project and an experiment in the principle of separating information from its representation.
    The information in the CV is stored in a plain text file, using YAML (a very lightweight markup language).
    It is transformed into HTML using the programming language Clojure, and styled with CSS.

timeline:
  - period: Summer 2013
    activity: |
      Started working remotely for EvoEnergy, with reduced hours.
      With my newly freed up time, began doing a bit of freelance work, and set about learning some new skills -
      most notably Objective-C. I'm working on an iPhone application in collaboration with
      an old university friend of mine.
  - period: Winter 2012
    activity: |
      Continued to work at EvoEnergy. After the feed-in tariff was cut, we needed to cut our costs drastically.
      I oversaw the systems aspect of replacing our (expensive!) 3rd party outsourced warehouse service with a completely in-house alternative.
      This included deploying off-the-shelf warehouse management software, writing data migration scripts, and integration services with to connect the
      new warehouse software to our own in house information system.
  - period: Autumn 2009
    activity: |
      Joined EvoEnergy when the company was 8 people strong.
      Initially carried out a number of roles ranging from on-site installation of PV monitoring systems to telephone support.
      Following the introduction of the feed-in tariff, the company began to grow and eventually reached ~180 people.
      Over this period, I gradually changed my role to Systems Developer. I rebuilt the information systems completely several times,
      taking them from a set of excel spreadsheets, to an Access Database, a SQL database with an old-school Windows Forms front end,
      and finally, after employing a second developer, to a much richer SQL database application, with a C# and WPF front end.
  - period: Summer 2009
    activity: |
      Went to Mafra, Portugal to take part in a Summer Academy in Human Centred Systems Design.
      Co-developed an educational workshop, based on David MacKay's book "Sustainable Energy Without The Hot Air".
  - period: Autumn 2008
    activity: |
      Switched to Mechanical Engineering, taking modules in Renewable Electrical Power, Information Theory and Pattern Recognition,
      Biomimicry, Sustainable Water Engineering, Design, Sustainable Development and Building Physics.
  - period: Summer 2008
    activity: |
      Did a UROP (undergraduate research opportunity). Investigated the mechanical performance of Structural Insulated Panels,
      and carried out a lifecycle analysis of papercrete (a building material made from recycled waste paper).
  - period: Summer 2007
    activity: |
      Worked at Cintelliq, consultants to the organic semiconductor industry. Helped with research, and preparing for their yearly conference.
  - period: Autumn 2006
    activity: |
     Specialised in Manufacturing Engineering.
     The course covered modules in Design, Industrial Engineering, Accounting and Finance, Human Relations and Organisational Behaviour.
     It also included a number of interesting industrial projects,
     including mapping information flows within a hummus factory, the design of a foldable Rogowski coil for current measurement,
     and writing software to co-ordinate a robotic manufacturing cell.
  - period: Summer 2005
    activity: |
      Worked at Stage Technologies as an engineer, drawing circuit diagrams and wiring up drive automation for West End stage shows.
  - period: Autumn 2004
    activity: |
      Went to Cambridge to read Engineering at Emmanuel College. The first two years of the course provided a general engineering
      foundation with  modules in Mechanics, Structures, Thermofluids, Materials, Linear Systems and Control,
      Thermofluids, Digital and Analogue Circuits, Electrical Power, Signal and Data Analysis.
  - period: Autumn 2003
    activity: |
      Took a gap year. Spent the first month in a primary school in Calais,  helping out as a teaching assistant. Subsequently worked as an assistant to a photographer
      at "Picture This" in Canterbury, Kent. For the rest of the year I was employed by Christ Church University as a project co-ordinator,
      where I researched, wrote and designed a guide book for people who were considering moving to the Nord Pas-de-Calais to work.
  - period: 1996
    activity: |
      Started secondary school. While I was there, I also led the school orchestra as a violinist, played in a string quartet and
