about: 
  me: |
    Systems developer. I believe that, through the use of computers, people can be freed to become more human. 
    I enjoy building systems that take away the mundane, and the repetitive. No-one should ever have to enter 
    the same piece of information twice in two different computer systems. I'm a fast learner, equally capable
    of working by myself or in a team.

    I designed this CV as a programming project and an experiment in the principle of separating information from its representation.
    The information in the CV is stored in a plain text file, using YAML (a very lightweight markup language). 
    It is transformed into HTML using the programming language Clojure, and styled with CSS.
    The source code for the CV is available online at http://www.github.com/

    activity: |
      Worked at EvoEnergy. I joined when the company was 10 people strong, and initially carried out a number of roles, including on-site installation of PV monitoring systems, telephone support, sales and 
      administration. Following the introduction of the feed-in tariff in April 2010, I became the company's Systems Developer. In this role, I rebuilt the information systems completely several times, 
      taking them from a set of excel spreadsheets, to an Access Database, a SQL database with VB.Net and WinForms front end, and finally, after employing a second developer, to a much richer SQL database
      application, with a beautiful C# and WPF front end.
