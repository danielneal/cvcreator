about: |
  Systems developer. I believe that, through the use of computers, people can be freed to become more human. 
  I enjoy building systems that take away the mundane, and the repetitive. No-one should ever have to enter 
  the same piece of information twice in two different computer systems. I'm a fast learner, equally capable
  of working by myself or in a team.
