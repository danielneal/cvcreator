about: 
  jobtitle: Systems developer
  me: |
    I like to design and build systems. Well designed systems have the power to take away the mechanical 
    and the repetitive, allowing us to focus on the most truly human aspects of our roles. I enjoy 
    making beautiful things - and I always strive for elegance whether I am writing code, designing interfaces, 
    or performing music. I have quite a broad range of knowledge, particularly in engineering, 
    and I'm capable of picking up new skills and concepts very quickly.
    capable of delivering complex projects on time whether working individually or in a small team of like-minded people.

    I designed this CV as a programming project and an experiment in the principle of separating information from its representation.
    The information in the CV is stored in a plain text file, using YAML (a very lightweight markup language). 
    It is transformed into HTML using the programming language Clojure, and styled with CSS.

      Joined EvoEnergy  when the company was 8 people strong (now ~ 180).  Initially carried out a number of roles from on-site installation of PV monitoring systems to telephone support.

      taking them from a set of excel spreadsheets, to an Access Database, a SQL database with VB.Net and WinForms front end, and finally, after employing a second developer, to a
      much richer SQL database application, with a C# and WPF front end.
