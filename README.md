# CV creator

An experiment in separating content from presentation, and
brushing up on how CSS layout works.

The tool takes CV data in a plain text file as input, and produces
a styled HTML and CSS file.

## Usage

 - Edit the cv.yml file in the input directory
 - Load up a clojure repl
 - Run the (write-cv) function
 - Examine the contents of the output directory
